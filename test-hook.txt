Hook Testing Status and Instructions
====================================

ISSUE: PostToolUse hook for auto-commit is not triggering after Write operations

WHAT WE'VE TRIED:
1. Created hook config at .claude/hooks/post_write_auto_commit.json (incorrect location)
2. Added hook config to .claude/settings.local.json with proper structure
3. Hook configuration includes:
   - Event: PostToolUse
   - Matcher: Write
   - Command: Auto-commit with timestamped message
   - Timeout: 60 seconds

FIXES APPLIED (2025-08-05):
1. Removed duplicate/incorrect hook configuration from .claude/hooks/ directory
2. Updated matcher from "Write" to "Edit|Write|MultiEdit" to catch all file modifications
3. Added test echo hook to verify hook triggering
4. Research findings:
   - Known bugs with PostToolUse hooks in Claude Code
   - Wildcard matcher "*" doesn't work (use "" instead)
   - Exit code 1 incorrectly blocks execution
   - Template variables like {{tool.name}} don't get replaced

CURRENT CONFIGURATION:
- Location: .claude/settings.local.json
- Matcher: "Edit|Write|MultiEdit"
- Two hooks configured:
  1. Echo test hook (writes to hook-test.log)
  2. Auto-commit hook (original git commit command)

NEXT STEPS TO TEST:
1. Restart Claude Code session (may be required for hooks to activate)
2. Make a test edit to any file
3. Check if hook-test.log file is created
4. Check git log for auto-commit
5. If hooks still don't work:
   - Try using PreToolUse instead of PostToolUse
   - Test with desktop app vs web version
   - Use /hooks slash command for interactive configuration

VERIFICATION COMMANDS:
- Check hook log: cat hook-test.log
- Check git commits: git log --oneline -5
- Check git status: git status --short

NOTE: Based on research, session restart may be required after hook configuration changes
